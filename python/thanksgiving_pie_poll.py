# Background
# In this project, students use Python to create a program that creates a vote count of Thanksgiving pies. They will use functions, loops, and if-else statements.

# Complete the following tasks:

# Ask for the number of people coming to Thanksgiving dinner
# Ask for the number of votes for each pie type
# Continually ask the user for the number of votes for each pie type until a viable value is found
# A check_votes function will be used to check that the number of votes given is acceptable based on the number of people attending dinner
# Update the number of votes for each pie type as well as the number of total votes from guests
# Print the votes for each pie type, the total vote count, and the number of people who did not vote
