![](https://github.com/abelberhane/TheDangerRoom/blob/main/images/2022-09-02%2010-55-40.gif?raw=true)
Increase your hand eye coordination with this simple ruby based FPS shooting reaction trainer. This program is very similar to the Steam game, Aim Hero.

## Areas of Focus:
1) Practice the fundamentals of Ruby
2) Gain experience using the Ruby2d UI
3) Documentation/markdown - I will also work on my markdown, formatting and presentation of my ideas in this repo.

----------------------  

## How to Play
The steps to run the game are very simple! 
- Step 1 - Download the source code with `git clone https://www.github.com/abelberhane/thedangerroom.git`
- Step 2 - Change your directory to be located inside the projects main directory with `cd Desktop/code/TheDangerRoom/ruby/projects/reaction-trainer/`
- Step 3 - run the program with `ruby reaction-trainer.rb`
- Step 4 - Press your mouse button in the newly popped up window to begin and remove the label
- Step 5 - Try to press the randomly generated target that just popped up
- Step 6 - Thats it!

----------------------

## How it Works
The game begins with a simple label asking the user to press a mouse button to initiate. Once the game starts, the program waits to detect a mouse press and if it has
touched the target. If the mouse hits the target, the target is removed and the amount of milliseconds it took for you to click it is presented on the screen. You then
have the opportunity to play the game again and beat your previous score by pressing once more and beginning the process ove again. If you missed the target, you continue to press your mouse until you do hit the target.

While I did not create the logic for this game, I am breaking every line down to ensure I understand it. I am also improving upon the original idea and code by implementing changes of its own.
